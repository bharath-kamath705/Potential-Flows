# Potential-Flows
pflow.py is a module with functions that return the velocity field and stream function for sources, sinks, vortices, doublets and uniform flows given the grid and locations of the singularities. Other scripts included are flow fields generated by superposition of elementary flows - lifting cylinder (uniform flow + doublet + vortex), Rankine oval ( source and sink separated by a distance in uniform flow) and the flow generated by a row of vortices.
